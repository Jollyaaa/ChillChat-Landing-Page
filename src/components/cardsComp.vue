              A solid social support network can help people manage stress, boost resilience, 
              and enhance their general mental health. Strong interpersonal connections with 
              friends, family, and the community are associated with better mental health outcomes than isolation.

            <p class="card-text">
              Mental and physical health are intertwined. Mental health can benefit from exercise, 
              a decent diet, enough sleep, and abstinence from drugs and alcohol. On the other hand, 
              mental health issues might be made more likely by poor physical health.

            <p class="card-text">
              Environmental aspects including one's living situation, resource availability, 
              and stress exposure can also have an impact on one's mental health. 
              Individuals who live in secure, encouraging situations typically enjoy better outcomes for 
              their mental health than those who endure persistent stress or trauma. 
              The promotion of healthy mental health also depends on having access to resources and mental health services.
